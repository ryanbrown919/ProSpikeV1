IGEN 330 Volleyball Setting Machine Interface V1

Hello! This project is an interface for our Third Year Term project, a Volleyball Setting Machine. 
This program is coded in C# and XAML and serially connects to a microcontroller, 
  which gets the data from the program and controls the speed and angle of the launching mechanism. 

Keep an eye f=out for that code as well coming soon.
